# Being inefficient when I should know better

This career change has been an interesting case study for me to self-analyze at times. 

In my last career (which is also to say my first and only one because I don't quite count this one yet), I was kind of regarded as the resident expert on a pretty complicated ERP. The answers to problems just flew to me, it required very little effort except when I tried to help others less efficient (but more experienced) see and think in those same ways. I'd watch them be less efficient and think 'oh if only they came at it this way'. A more concrete example.. someone would be debugging something for hours, maybe days and I'd think "they get off track and then just doggedly stick to it, if they just stopped every hour, walked around the block and took a break from it - they'd probably see it from the right angle." I thought this I think because that's mostly what I did and I was wildly successful (in the small pond that it was.)

But now, here I am in a new technology stack and see myself doing that same exact inefficient thing. For days now I've told myself I need to change that behaviour.. but hours go by and I don't realize it. A coworker has a timer that goes off to alert him he needs a break every hour - according to him, he is so used to ignoring it or hitting snooze it doesn't require concious thought anymore.

Is it that the pace of the two companies are different between now and then (because they are wildly different)? - likely not a big factor.

Is it that I should have been more understanding of the struggles of others in my past life? - definitely

Isn't this what I went through way back when I first was trying to learn that ERP that I became so familiar with? - oh yeah it is

Anyway, maybe I should cut myself more slack, but that's not likely to happen. I want to be better, I know how, and I should know better.
