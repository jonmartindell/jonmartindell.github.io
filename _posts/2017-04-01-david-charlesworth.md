I wasn't that into David Charlesworth's approach and instruction at first. I felt like it was too slow, picky, and not focused on the right aspects when woodworking. However, after some more real world experience I've really changed my mind completely. I think going slow and at the level of precision he practices is definitely the right approach for a beginner like myself. I've found the more I read his info the more practical I find all of it.
