I liked this book. It's got a good mix of real world advice and inspiration in it. I liked the practical aspect of it, some of the other 'family camping activities' type books I read I'm not as into. This had some of that as well but also very experienced but basic advice like how to have everyone be part of the chores and 'work' involved in camping.
