# Playdough Craftsman

I'm really intrigued by this concept of 'craftsmanship' in terms of programming. I think it's a great focus and discussion for us all. We live in such a throw away culture though, I don't even know what a craftman or craftsmanship really is...

I often get enamored with things from the past. Eric Sloane's books about the nature of wood tools - how they'll live long after your metal ones have rusted away. About fine furniture where the dovetailed and drawbored joints will hold together long after the glue has disintegrated. 18th century craftsman who made things like this - still good 200 years later: (insert pennsylvania secretary image). Or a mechanic, using the right materials, who built motors like this that still run 100 years later (another image?).

And I look at what we do as programmers. What's the life expectancy? When does it lose its usefulness? My old dishwasher used a lot of water but the dishes came out clean and it never broke. I bought a new one a few years ago for $300 - after two years the electronic button panel broke which cost $100. That replacement one broke the next year for another $100. And again, now 3 times in a row. I also don't think it cleans very well.

But am I right in these things? What was it like to be an 18th century woodworking craftsman? Did 90% of their work also burn up, or crash under the weight of climbing toddlers? Am I just seeing [survivorship bias ?] (http://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/)

The latest episode of ruby rogues talked about the tools we use: http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/204-rr-limerence-with-dave-thomas and how we often switch off tools a lot in our line of work.

I know for me when I'm working around the house or on the car or doing some woodworking - a big part of the solution depends on the tools. Not the tools, but my knowledge and understanding of them. I feel so clumsy and out of place when I'm trying to work in my dad's garage or my brother's. I know where nothing is, I'm looking for a screwdriver like I have that's long enough with a small enough point to wedge in to this area and twist this thing I need to twist. I'm looking for my needle nose pliars that I know how they feel, what they can pick up and what they can't. I'm looking at this problem of how to remove this part of wood here, and I'm thinking of the tools I have available. I think about chisels because I don't have a table saw. If I had a table saw and no chisels I would be evaluating solutions to this wood-removing-problem in a different way.

But my point with the title and this post - I love the idea of craftsmanship in our coding. But are we kidding ourselves? Are we playing with playdough that just gets smushed back into the container when we're done with it like so many bytes on the internet? Are we craving something our medium is never going to supply?

I actually don't think so, but it sure feels that way at times.
