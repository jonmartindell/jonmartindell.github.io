# Programming Abstinence

I was listening to the latest ruby rogues episode: http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/204-rr-limerence-with-dave-thomas and was reminded of the [Distraction Addiction book](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FThe-Distraction-Addiction-Information-Communication%2Fdp%2F0316208264&ei=vEQ6VcnNIIywggSyqYCgBw&usg=AFQjCNFWkui8TYqVYqkHOQo3LdcicGfcwg&sig2=wm9nKZZ-Bcy5UntZ--sb8g) I read last summer.

Especially with my move into this new world of mainstream development it seems like a huge exercise in group think as well as other things. Part of the ruby rogues podcast brought up how little we (as a group) mine the past information or computer science research and discoveries.

I had an idea of how we could do this better.. forced technology abstinence. My first thought was a company mandated week in a cabin or likewise without any technology. Just books/papers about technology, pen, _maybe_ paper. But then I thought, why go out for steaks when you have bacon at home? Just do the same thing but make them come into the office. Then we'd all get to see the experience, see if they're doing it, watch them slowly lose it when everyone around them is programming and they can't. (Then again, what if they often reach enlightment, move to a cabin in the woods, and we slowly kill off all our staff?!)

I'd like to try it myself but I'm not sure it would really have any lasting impact. Maybe if we had them write a blog post afterwards?

I don't know.. sometimes I feel like I'm trying to build sand castles when I should be grabbing a surfboard.
